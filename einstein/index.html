    <h3>10 Things You didn't Know</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>SPEECH. Einstein was supposedly slow to talk—the man himself told his biographer he didn’t start speaking
            until at least age three. Stanford economist Dr. Thomas Sowell even coined the controversial term “Einstein
            Syndrome” to describe exceptionally bright people whose speech is delayed.</li>
        <li>COMPASS. When Albert Einstein was five years old his father showed him a simple pocket compass. Einstein was
            mesmerized. What force exerted itself on the little needle to make it point in a single direction? This
            question stayed with Einstein for many years and has been noted as the beginning of his fascination with
            science.</li>
        <li>VIOLIN. Einstein’s mother, Pauline, was an accomplished pianist and wanted her son to love music too, so she
            started him on violin lessons. At first, Einstein hated playing the violin. When Einstein was 13-years old,
            he quickly changed his mind about the violin when he heard the music of Mozart. With a new passion for
            playing, Einstein continued to play the violin until the last few years of his life.</li>
        <li>PRESIDENT EINSTEIN? A few days after Zionist leader and first President of Israel Chaim Weizmann died on
            November 9, 1952, Einstein was asked if he would accept the position of being the second president of
            Israel. Einstein, age 73, declined the offer. In his official letter of refusal, Einstein stated that he
            lacked the “natural aptitude and the experience to deal properly with people.”</li>
        <li>CAPTAIN EINSTEIN. Einstein loved sailing, even though he wasn’t very good at it—his neighbors on Long Island
            frequently had to help him right his capsized boat Tinef (Yiddish for “worthless”). And even though Einstein
            never learned to swim, he kept sailing as a hobby throughout his life.</li>
        <li>NO SOCKS. Part of Einstein’s charm was his disheveled look. In addition to his uncombed hair, one of
            Einstein’s peculiar habits was to never wear socks. To Einstein, socks were a pain because they often would
            get holes in them.</li>
        <li>SMOKING. Einstein loved to smoke. In 1950, after accepting a life membership in the Montreal Pipe Smokers
            Club, Einstein said he believed “that pipe smoking contributes to a somewhat calm and objective judgment in
            all human affairs.”</li>
        <li>INVENTOR. More than two decades after publishing his Special Theory of Relativity, Albert Einstein
            co-invented a refrigerator (with his former student Leo Szilard) that operated on compressed gases. Einstein
            was moved to create the device after reading about a Berlin family killed by toxic fumes from their fridge.
            The Einstein-Szilard refrigerator was patented in 1930 but was soon overshadowed by freon-based compressors
            that were more efficient, but more damaging to the environment.</li>
        <li>LETTERS. Einstein himself did not create the atomic bomb or even work on the Manhattan Project (he was
            denied the security clearance by the U.S. Army, which looked askance at his left-leaning politics). But both
            Einstein’s letters to then-U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt outlining the theory of a uranium fission
            bomb and his famous formula, E=mc², linking mass and energy, helped spur the development of nuclear weapons.
            Einstein later regretted his involvement, telling Newsweek that “had I known that the Germans would not
            succeed in developing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing.”</li>
        <li>ANAGRAM. ‘Albert Einstein’ is an anagram of ‘Ten elite brains’.</li>
